# 🌍 Translation Commons

**Translation Commons** is a nonprofit platform that collaborates with Indigenous and minority communities to bridge the digital divide.  

We help communities digitize their native languages through:
- Global conferences and knowledge sharing  
- Guidelines and hands-on training  
- Custom keyboards and language tools  
- Community-driven open-source projects
